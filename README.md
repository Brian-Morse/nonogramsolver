# Nonogram Puzzle Solver

This is a Nonogram solver that can solve any sized puzzle as long as there is a single valid solution (If there is no solution or multiple solutions, the solver will convey that)

Choose the size of the puzzle you would like to solve and that will take you to a new screen with many empty text boxes on the side and a calculate button

Fill in the empty text boxes with the numbers found in your nonogram puzzle. If there are multiple numbers for a row or column, use spaces, commas, or semicolons as delimiters

Once everything is correctly filled in, press calculate and the screen will update, displaying the solution to the puzzle that can then be used to solve the puzzle on your device
